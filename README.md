#CMSC6950 - Assignment 3 for Atiyeh Tahavorgar

Git is a dirtributed version control system that was created by
Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux Kernel.

The basic Git workflow consists of the following steps:
1. create or edit files.
2. add the new or changed files to the staging area.
3. store your changes in the git database, by making a commit.
4. choose an informative commit message. This helps at a later tiime to find
specific commits and to understand the intention of the changes.
5. continue at step 1.

Unlike centralized version control systems, git users can commit new changes,
without the need of an internet connection. They can offline and then later
push batches of commits at once to a server - like GitHub or Bitbucket.
